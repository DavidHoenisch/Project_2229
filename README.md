# Project_2229
My journey to hone, improve and master the craft of cybersecurity.

2229 is short for Proverbs 22:29: "do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before Kings, he will not stand before obscure men."  While my intent in not to stand before kings, my intent is to be skilled in my work.  There is much for me to learn.  Cybersecurity is one of those jobs that makes me tick.  What I lack in knowledge I make up for in thirst to learn.  I know there are many other people who find themselves in the same boat, and so, to help other along the way I figured I would share what it is that I am learning.
