# Projects

Projects outside of work are probably the best way to learn anything that you really want to get good at.  This is how I learned linux, bash, Ansible, and a host of other cybersecurity related topics.  Do yourself a favor and take on some projects.  If you are like me you will miserably fail in the process of working on them.  But in the end, you will have a much better understanding of the over all technology than 80% of other people.  The process of failing, searching for answers, and trouble shooting has a way of teaching how a tool or concept works than anything else I can think of.  Here's a list of some of the personal projects that I have or am currently working on.  

### Note: 
For those looking to gain more experiance in cybersecurity, start some personal projects.  It shows you have a thirst to learn and a willingness and drive to push yourself to learn.  It is a discipline, but you will thank yourself.  

1. ## NextCloud
I used a Pi4 and a RAID array to build my own Nextcloud server.


2. ## Git Server
Pi project again.  This one really helped me get a better understanding of how Git works


3. ## WireGuard VPN
I hosted this on some cheap VPS' online.  This was my trial by fire into Ansible and overall linux server administration


4. ## Pi-Hole
Pi project again, and yes, I am running out of Pi's.  This one is great for visibility into your network as well as learning how DNS works, or should say, how it has worked for the past long while (DNS is changing quite a bit with the invent of DOH).


4. ## Zeek
Yep, you guessed it, Pi project again.  If you are not using Zeek, you should be.  Seriously.  Hands down the best visibility tool to have on your network.


5. ## Wazuh
I'm a total nerd, so why would I not run a SIEM on my home network?  Yes, SecurityOnion would be better for this, but alas, The install script seems to be broken...


6. ## PFsense
This is a great firewall to bite into.  Not only will you probably break your LAN and take you hours to get back online {cough cough -- vlans!} but you will learn the basics of networking in a very hands on way.  Plus, it is a great tool for security, so go get a pfsense firewall! 

7. ## Openmediavault
Confession, I liked nextcloud, but it broke somewhere along the way and I never figure it out.  That and there were some bugs in the mobile applications that casued some security issues so I scrubbed that project and I set up an Openmediavault server.  So far so good!
