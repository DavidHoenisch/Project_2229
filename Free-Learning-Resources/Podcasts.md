# Podcasts

A great way to learn new skill and concepts is through podcasts.  Below you will find my go-to podcasts for learning more about cybersecurity.


1. ## [Blueprint](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xMTQyNzIwLnJzcw?sa=X&ved=0CBoQ27cFahcKEwjoipP1kZb0AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg)
This is a fairly new one for me.  It is hosted by John Hubbard who has become my go to for Blue Team content. 

2. ## [Darknet Diaries](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vZGFya25ldGRpYXJpZXM)
This one is great for learning about the world of cybersecurity in general, not necessarily specific skills.
